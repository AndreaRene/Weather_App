# Quick Weather

This application is a leightweight weather dashboard that will allow the user to search for weather data based on a city name. You can find the application [here]() I designed it to meet the following criteria:

* A simple weather dashboared that will display the currenttemperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index at the desired location
* A weather dashboard that will display the 5 day forecast at the desired location
* A weather dashboard that indicates at a glance the severity of the UV Index
* A weather dashboard that will save a user's search history whish will persist through refreshing or closing. 
* A way for the user to clear the entire search history at once if desired.
* A simple, no frills design targeted at mobile users who may not be particularly tech savvy. 
* An interface that is intuitive for users 
* An application that is easily scaleable and expandable
* A simple and clean interface with a responsive design that accomodates screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px
